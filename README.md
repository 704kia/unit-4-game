# Crystal Collector Game

This game is my Unit 4 homework submission for UNC Charlotte's Coding Bootcamp.

The objective of this assignment was to build an interactive game where the HTML is dynamically updated using the jQuery library.

# How To Play

You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you lose the game if your total score goes
above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
Each time the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal and the target number.
